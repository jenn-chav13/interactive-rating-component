## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I decided to try my hand at React. I tried to keep the code as clean and readable as posible.
Doing that, I learned how to pass a component into another. 
Also, I learned how to deploy a React app using Github Pages. It was difficult and it didn't work at first, but it worked out in the end. I think turning the property `private` property to `false` in the `package.json` helped when deploying the code using Github Pages.

### Some code I am proud of


```jsx
<React.StrictMode>
    <RatingComponent title="How did we do?" description="
      Please let us know how we did with your support request. All feedback is appreciated 
      to help us improve our offering!" ratingOptions={[1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]}/>
    <AttributionComponent author="Jenn ChavarrÃ­a" profileLink="https://github.com/jenn-chav13"/> 
  </React.StrictMode>
```
